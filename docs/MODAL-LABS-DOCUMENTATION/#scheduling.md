# API Reference <a id="api-reference"></a>
This is the API reference for the Python package, which allows you to run distributed applications on Modal.
The reference is intended to be limited to low-level descriptions of various programmatic functionality. If youre just getting started with Modal, we would instead recommend looking at the guide (https://modal.com/docs/guide) first or to get started quickly with an example (https://modal.com/docs/examples).
## Application construction <a id="application-construction"></a>
`App` (https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.App) | The main unit of deployment for code on Modal - --|--- `App.function` (https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.App# function) | Decorator for registering a function with an App `App.cls` (https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.App# cls) | Decorator for registering a class with an App ## Serverless execution
`Function` (https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.Function) | A serverless function backed by an autoscaling container pool - --|--- `Cls` (https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.Cls) | A serverless class supporting parametrization and lifecycle hooks ## Extended Function configuration
### Class parametrization <a id="class-parametrization"></a>
