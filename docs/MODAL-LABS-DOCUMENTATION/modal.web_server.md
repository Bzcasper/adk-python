  custom_domains: Optional[Iterable[str]] = None, # Deploy this endpoint on a custom domain.

```
 Decorator that registers an HTTP web server inside the container.
This is similar to `@asgi_app` and `@wsgi_app`, but it allows you to expose a full HTTP server listening on a container port. This is useful for servers written in other languages like Rust, as well as integrating with non-ASGI frameworks like aiohttp and Tornado.
* *Usage:**
```
import subprocess
@app.function()
@modal.web_server(8000)
def my_file_server():
  subprocess.Popen("python -m http.server -d / 8000", shell=True)
```
 The above example starts a simple file server, displaying the contents of the root directory. Here, requests to the web endpoint will go to external port 8000 on the container. The `http.server` module is included with Python, but you could run anything here.
Internally, the web server is transparently converted into a web endpoint by Modal, so it has the same serverless autoscaling behavior as other web endpoints.
