Market Research: Content Repurposing and Automation Platform
Based on my research, I've identified a significant market opportunity that aligns perfectly with your technical skills and business goals: an intelligent content repurposing and automation platform.
The Problem: Content Creation Challenges in 2025
Businesses face several critical challenges with content creation and monetization:

Resource Limitations: 51% of content professionals cite keeping up with content demands for various channels as a top challenge, while 43% struggle with allocating adequate budget or resources. MarketingProfs
Standing Out in AI-Generated Content: As content marketers use AI to increase efficiencies and expand production, they face the challenge of "how to stand out in a sea of sameness" where many competitors are using similar AI tools. Contentmarketinginstitute
Repurposing Inefficiency: Content marketers face significant challenges with content repurposing (44%), creating differentiated content (43%), and creating enough content (37%). Contentmarketinginstitute
Content ROI Measurement: 56% of B2B marketers struggle with "difficulty attributing ROI to content efforts" and tracking customer journeys. Contentmarketinginstitute
