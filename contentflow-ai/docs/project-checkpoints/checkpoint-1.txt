ContentFlow AI - Project Checkpoint
Date: 2025-04-15

Project Overview
ContentFlow AI is an intelligent content repurposing and automation platform that leverages AI technologies to extract, transform, and distribute content across multiple formats and platforms. The platform uses Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK), Modal Labs GPUs, crawl4ai, yt-dlp, and ffmpeg to create a powerful content processing pipeline.
