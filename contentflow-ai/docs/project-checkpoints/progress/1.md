I've successfully implemented high-performance model serving capabilities for the ContentFlow AI platform! Let me summarize what we've accomplished:

Implementation Summary
TextTransformationAgent
Created a versatile agent that leverages vLLM for efficient text transformations
Implemented three key transformation methods:
summarize_text: Condenses content while preserving key information
change_style: Transforms text to different writing styles (formal, casual, etc.)
convert_format: Converts content between formats (markdown, HTML, JSON, etc.)
Added fallback to Google's ADK when vLLM is unavailable
Unit Tests
Implemented comprehensive tests for the TextTransformationAgent
Covered both successful vLLM operations and fallback scenarios
Used mock objects to simulate vLLM service responses
Modal Labs Integration
Enhanced the deployment.py file with vLLM service integration
Added FastAPI endpoints for model management and text generation
Implemented proper error handling and response validation
API Endpoints
/models: Lists all available models with detailed information
/models/{model_name}: Gets information about a specific model
/models/generate: Generates text using a specified model
/models/download/{model_name}: Downloads a model for use with vLLM
/transform: Transforms content using the TextTransformationAgent
Model Support
Added support for commercial-use friendly open-source models:
Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2
Meta Llama 3 8B Instruct
Microsoft Phi-3 Medium (14B)
Google Gemma 7B Instruct
This implementation provides a solid foundation for the content transformation capabilities of ContentFlow AI, enabling high-quality text generation, summarization, and format conversion using state-of-the-art language models with optimized performance through vLLM and torch.compile.

The next steps would be to implement the Image Transformation Agent and Audio Transformation Agent to complete Phase 3 of the project.
